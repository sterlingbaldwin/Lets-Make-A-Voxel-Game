# Lets-Make-A-Voxel-Game
Im going through the Lets Make A Voxel game one episode at a time and uploading the code. 


## NOTES

* Episode 1: Everything should work out of the box. You will need to setup a game object and add the world as its script
* Episode 2: You're going to need to setup your own textures. I bought a quick pack for $2 off itch.io. Make sure to import them, and use the texture editor in unity to assign them the correct names, or just change the texture names in the TextureController to whatever you want. Also you'll need to make a new material and set the World game object to use it as well as the new textures.
